Hello! I'm a web developer with a passion for creating engaging and dynamic websites and applications. Currently, I'm focusing on becoming a full-stack developer, expanding my skills beyond front-end development to include back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases like MySQL. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.
